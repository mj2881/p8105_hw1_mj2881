# Problem 1

## code chunk 1

Create a data frame comprised of:

* a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
* a character vector of length 8
* a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”


```{r problem_one}

one_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = sample > 0,
  chr_vector = c('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h'),
  vec_factor = factor(c("big","med","small","big","med","small","big","small"))
)

```
